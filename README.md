# OrganoGram

OrganoGram is a personal project I am working on to improve my React skills. It is derived from Alura's [React: desenvolvendo com JavaScript](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/react-desenvolvendo-javascript) course. Alura is a Brazilian online school of technology with over 1400 courses on IT-related subjects.

I am currently in the initial stages of this projects, so there isn't much to see yet. I am also recreating the design system they propose for the project to practice design and layout implementation.
